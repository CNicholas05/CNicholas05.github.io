<p>
	Guten tag my name is Connor, <br>
	I am 16 years old and live in Brisbane,<br> </p>
<p>	I am currently doing grade 12 via home-schooling and studying Introduction to Information Technology as 1 of my subjects for term 1. <br>
	in my free time I like to exercise, game and learn little bits of German as a second language </p>
		
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> I am not quite sure why I am so interested in computers, <br>
 all I do know is that since I was a small child, I have been trying to figure them out, of course living in a small town makes this difficult. <br>
 My father is the biggest inspiration to get into computers,<br>
 he would always explain things in deep and passionate detail whenever I asked him about his own pc when I was younger and from there on I always tried to find computers I could tinker with, <br>
 that started out with me simply teaching all the other prep kids how to use google and helping my grandparents with computer issues, <br>
 to making computers for friends and siblings who aren’t very tech literate. <br>
I was looking for my next subject on Open University and found that RMIT was the most appealing to me. RMIT has a very good reputation, and I knew that my learning would be in good hands. The RMIT campus is also in Melbourne, <br>I have a lot of family in Melbourne so I knew that if I ever wanted to work on campus, which I do, <br>then I would have an easy time acclimating to the area. Introduction to Information Technology, in my mind, read as a gateway into further education into IT, accepted HECS-HELP loans and was within my budget,<br> so I signed up.
By the end of this current course, I hope to have learned skills that I can apply in a future job. I want to learn to use HTML to create a website, to use programs like GitHub to collaborate with peers in an effective manner, <br> and to learn the current state of the IT industry from a professional within it.  </p>

<h3>  Ideal Job    </h3>

<p>I am not entirely sure what my Ideal job would be,<br> but I think I would enjoy the Software Engineer job listing, it would pay a reasonable amount and I would be good at it, in the future. <br> The google name itself is not an important part of what makes it appealing to me but instead the actual role is. <br> As far as I can tell, the job listing is for a general software developer for google and its services, services such as google drive which is used by hundreds of thousands of people around the world,<br> for everything from storing family photos to sharing assets for group projects.<br> It is important work to uphold a product that many people rely on in their day to day lives, I would enjoy a more niche or smaller job but there is something extremely appealing about a job that reaches so many people.<br>
A high-profile job like this one requires many different things.<br> The to be employee needs extensive job experience in the field, A bachelor’s degree is required but the Applicant would have a higher chance of getting the job with a PhD or master’s degree. <br> Experience with team-based work would be extremely important,<br> as google is a big company with lots of people who all must be working in synch with each other. </p>

<p> While not being the best way to understand a person, personality tests like these can give quick and easy insight into a person’s behaviours and state of mind.<br> I have a lot of nervous energy which the tests results reflect, this means that I am constantly looking for stimuli, which can be an advantage and disadvantage as I will focus on a subject and divert all that nervous energy into it, however I can also be distracted easily and need to constantly remind myself to stay on subject.<br>
It may be difficult to initially interact with a classmate but when I get to know them I can easily work with anyone, and despite the tests results, I am very good at sharing work with peers on time.<br>
when forming a team I need to make sure that we have a strict understanding of a schedule so that I can set plenty of reminders on when I need to share work with people and constantly stay in touch with them so as to keep my mind on the current task, <br>this can be done with apps such as discord, Microsoft teams, skype etc </p>


<h3>Project Idea </h3>
	<p>My current idea for a project is an open-source program for real time frame interpolation.<br> This will be mainly useful in the gaming space where you would have double the fps but with a bit more delay, in slower games this delay will not matter and could potentially lead to a better user experience for otherwise unoptimized games.<br> By keeping it open source, people could modify it to work with other engines.<br> The main goal would be to get a version of it that would work in a popular engine like unreal engine.
Many modern TV’s have a feature for real time frame interpolation that can make gaming on consoles be an even more enjoyable, depending on the TV of course, however such a feature is lacking in the PC market, but I can’t figure out why.<br> Many games have a locked render frame rate, for different reasons for every game, so there is a real niche market for a program that can accomplish real-time frame interpolation.<br>
Without the use of machine learning or AI you cannot interpolate into the future, so instead you have to accept a 1 frame delay, meaning you always have to be at least 1 rendered frame behind what would otherwise be displayed, then by finding the high contrast pixel movement between your current frame and your future unrendered frame, you get an extra frame in the middle, essentially achieving a higher Framerate.<br> The program would have to be tweaked optimistically per engine, more realistically per game, this becomes less of a program by making it open source, as users can share config files for the program that allows it to be used for another engine or another game.<br>
This project would be written from scratch in C++, the only programs required would be a suitable C++ development environment, programs such as eclipse or Microsoft Visual Studio and the engine that I want to interpolate in, in this case unreal engine.<br> Programs such as GitHub would be useful to share progress on.<br>
While all this is good on paper, I do not have a deep enough understanding of the required skills to go ahead with this project.<br> First, I would need to learn how to properly code in C++ as my current skills are extremely basic.<br> Secondly, I would need a better understanding of Unreal engines render layer and how it interacts with Directx 11 and Directx 12.<br> As I progress, I may find that this project is simply not feasible in the time span, I will have to learn more about IT to fully understand the task ahead of me.<br>
If this project is feasible, realistic and I succeed then what results is a program that can benefit the users experience in games that do not require low latency and are otherwise perhaps unoptimized.<br> An extreme niche exists, and I hope with this program I could fill it.<br> The development would have allowed me to learn more about IT and Computers, so the way I see it, it’s a win.<br>
