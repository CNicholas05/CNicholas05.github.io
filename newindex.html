<p>
	Guten tag my name is Connor, <br>
	I am 16 years old and live in Brisbane,<br> </p>
<p>	I am currently doing grade 12 via home-schooling and studying Introduction to Information Technology as 1 of my subjects for term 1. <br>
	in my free time I like to exercise, game and learn little bits of German as a second language </p>
		
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> I am not quite sure why I am so interested in computers, <br>
 all I do know is that since I was a small child, I have been trying to figure them out, of course living in a small town makes this difficult. <br>
 My father is the biggest inspiration to get into computers,<br>
 he would always explain things in deep and passionate detail whenever I asked him about his own pc when I was younger and from there on I always tried to find computers I could tinker with, <br>
 that started out with me simply teaching all the other prep kids how to use google and helping my grandparents with computer issues, <br>
 to making computers for friends and siblings who aren’t very tech literate. <br>
I was looking for my next subject on Open University and found that RMIT was the most appealing to me. RMIT has a very good reputation, and I knew that my learning would be in good hands. The RMIT campus is also in Melbourne, <br>I have a lot of family in Melbourne so I knew that if I ever wanted to work on campus, which I do, <br>then I would have an easy time acclimating to the area. Introduction to Information Technology, in my mind, read as a gateway into further education into IT, accepted HECS-HELP loans and was within my budget,<br> so I signed up.
By the end of this current course, I hope to have learned skills that I can apply in a future job. I want to learn to use HTML to create a website, to use programs like GitHub to collaborate with peers in an effective manner, <br> and to learn the current state of the IT industry from a professional within it.  </p>

<h3>  Ideal Job    </h3>

<p>I am not entirely sure what my Ideal job would be,<br> but I think I would enjoy the Software Engineer job listing, it would pay a reasonable amount and I would be good at it, in the future. <br> The google name itself is not an important part of what makes it appealing to me but instead the actual role is. <br> As far as I can tell, the job listing is for a general software developer for google and its services, services such as google drive which is used by hundreds of thousands of people around the world,<br> for everything from storing family photos to sharing assets for group projects.<br> It is important work to uphold a product that many people rely on in their day to day lives, I would enjoy a more niche or smaller job but there is something extremely appealing about a job that reaches so many people.<br>
A high-profile job like this one requires many different things.<br> The to be employee needs extensive job experience in the field, A bachelor’s degree is required but the Applicant would have a higher chance of getting the job with a PhD or master’s degree. <br> Experience with team-based work would be extremely important,<br> as google is a big company with lots of people who all must be working in synch with each other. </p>

<p> While not being the best way to understand a person, personality tests like these can give quick and easy insight into a person’s behaviours and state of mind.<br> I have a lot of nervous energy which the tests results reflect, this means that I am constantly looking for stimuli, which can be an advantage and disadvantage as I will focus on a subject and divert all that nervous energy into it, however I can also be distracted easily and need to constantly remind myself to stay on subject.<br>
It may be difficult to initially interact with a classmate but when I get to know them I can easily work with anyone, and despite the tests results, I am very good at sharing work with peers on time.<br>
when forming a team I need to make sure that we have a strict understanding of a schedule so that I can set plenty of reminders on when I need to share work with people and constantly stay in touch with them so as to keep my mind on the current task, <br>this can be done with apps such as discord, Microsoft teams, skype etc </p>
